Numbers

A number is used to count, measure, and represent quantities.
In mathematics, numbers are classified into different types based on their properties.

Natural Numbers

Natural numbers are the numbers used for counting.

Natural numbers are:

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, …

The set of natural numbers is denoted by N.

Whole Numbers

Whole numbers include all natural numbers and zero.

Whole numbers are:

0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, …

Integers

Integers include negative numbers, zero, and positive numbers.

Integers are:

…, −3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, …

The set of integers is denoted by Z.

Rational Numbers

A rational number is a number that can be written in the form p/q,
where p and q are integers and q ≠ 0.

Examples of rational numbers:
1/2, 3/4, −5/7, 2

Real Numbers

Real numbers include all numbers that can be represented on a number line.

They include:

Natural numbers

Whole numbers

Integers

Rational numbers

Irrational numbers

The set of real numbers is denoted by R.

Even Numbers

An even number is a number that is divisible by 2.

Examples:
2, 4, 6, 8, 10

Odd Numbers

An odd number is a number that is not divisible by 2.

Examples:
1, 3, 5, 7, 9

Prime Numbers

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has exactly two factors:
1 and the number itself.

Examples of prime numbers:
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13

Composite Numbers

A composite number is a natural number greater than 1 that has more than two factors.

Examples:
4, 6, 8, 9, 10

Factors

A factor of a number is a number that divides it exactly without leaving a remainder.

Example:
Factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6.

Multiples

A multiple of a number is obtained by multiplying it by a whole number.

Example:
Multiples of 3 are 3, 6, 9, 12, …

Divisibility

A number a is divisible by b if a ÷ b gives a whole number.

Examples:

6 is divisible by 3

7 is not divisible by 2

Inequalities

Inequalities are used to compare numbers.

x < y means x is less than y

x > y means x is greater than y

x ≤ y means x is less than or equal to y

x ≥ y means x is greater than or equal to y

Range of Numbers

A range describes numbers lying between two values.

Examples:

1 ≤ x ≤ 5 means x can be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5

3 < x < 7 means x can be 4, 5, or 6

Properties in Mathematics

A property is a rule or condition that elements must satisfy.

Examples of properties:

x is a prime number

x is an even natural number

x is divisible by 3

Finite and Infinite Collections

A finite collection has a limited number of elements.

An infinite collection has no end.

Examples:

The set {2, 4, 6} is finite.

The set of natural numbers is infinite.

Mathematical Symbols Used

= means equal to

≠ means not equal to

<, >, ≤, ≥ are comparison symbols

{ } are used to represent collections


SETS – INTRODUCTION (CLASS 11)

A set is a well-defined collection of objects.
The objects in a set are called its elements or members.
The words objects, elements, and members mean the same thing.

REPRESENTATION OF SETS

Sets are usually represented by capital letters such as A, B, C, X, Y, Z.

Elements of a set are represented by small letters such as a, b, c, x, y, z.

BELONGS TO SYMBOL ( ∈ )

If a is an element of a set A, we say
“a belongs to A” and write:

a ∈ A

The symbol ∈ (epsilon) means belongs to.

If b is not an element of set A, we write:

b ∉ A

This is read as “b does not belong to A”.

Examples:

Let V be the set of vowels in the English alphabet.
Then: a ∈ V but b ∉ V.

Let P be the set of prime factors of 30.
Then: 3 ∈ P but 15 ∉ P.

METHODS OF REPRESENTING A SET

There are two main methods of representing a set:

1. Roster (or Tabular) Form

2. Set-Builder Form

1. ROSTER FORM

In roster form:

All elements of a set are listed

- Elements are separated by commas

- The list is enclosed within braces { }

Example:

The set of all even positive integers less than 7 is:

{2, 4, 6}

More examples:

The set of all natural numbers which divide 42 is:

{1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42}

2. SET-BUILDER FORM

In set-builder form:

- Elements of a set are described by a common property

- This property is possessed only by elements of that set

Example:

The set of vowels in the English alphabet can be written as:

V = { x : x is a vowel in the English alphabet }

This is read as:
“The set of all x such that x is a vowel in the English alphabet.”

Important Notes:

The symbol x represents an element

The symbol : means such that

Braces { } mean the set of all

MORE EXAMPLES OF SET-BUILDER FORM

Let:

A = { x : x is a natural number and 3 < x < 10 }

This means:
x is a natural number lying between 3 and 10

So, the elements of set A are:

{4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

CONVERSION FROM ROSTER TO SET-BUILDER FORM

If the following sets are given in roster form:

A = {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42}
B = {a, e, i, o, u}
C = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ...}

Then they can be written in set-builder form as:

A = { x : x is a natural number which divides 42 }
B = { y : y is a vowel in the English alphabet }
C = { z : z is an odd natural number }

IMPORTANT STANDARD SETS IN MATHEMATICS

N : the set of all natural numbers

Z : the set of all integers

Q : the set of all rational numbers

R : the set of all real numbers

Z⁺ : the set of all positive integers

Q⁺ : the set of all positive rational numbers

R⁺ : the set of all positive real numbers

EMPTY SET (NULL SET / VOID SET)

A set which does not contain any element is called the empty set, null set, or void set.

The empty set is denoted by the symbol ∅ or { }.

Examples of Empty Sets:

Let
A = { x : 1 < x < 2, x is a natural number }
Then A is an empty set because there is no natural number between 1 and 2.

Let
B = { x : x² − 2 = 0 and x is a rational number }
Then B is an empty set because the equation x² − 2 = 0 has no rational solution.

Let
C = { x : x is an even prime number greater than 2 }
Then C is an empty set because 2 is the only even prime number.

Let
D = { x : x² = 4 and x is odd }
Then D is an empty set because x² = 4 is not satisfied by any odd number.

FINITE AND INFINITE SETS

A set which is empty or contains a finite number of elements is called a finite set.
A set which contains infinitely many elements is called an infinite set.

Examples:

Let W be the set of days of the week.
Then W is a finite set.

Let S be the set of solutions of the equation x² − 16 = 0.
Then S is a finite set.

Let G be the set of points on a line.
Then G is an infinite set.

Note:
In roster form, it is not possible to list all elements of an infinite set because the number of elements is not finite.

EQUAL AND UNEQUAL SETS

Two sets A and B are said to be equal if they have exactly the same elements.
We write A = B.

If the sets do not have the same elements, they are said to be unequal and we write A ≠ B.

Examples:

Let
A = {1, 2, 3, 4}
B = {3, 1, 4, 2}
Then A = B.

Let
A be the set of prime numbers less than 6
P be the set of prime factors of 30

Then A = P because both sets contain the elements {2, 3, 5}.

SUBSETS

A set A is said to be a subset of a set B if every element of A is also an element of B.

This is written as:
A ⊆ B

In symbolic form:
A ⊆ B if a ∈ A ⇒ a ∈ B

This is read as:
“A is a subset of B if every element of A implies that it belongs to B.”

If A is not a subset of B, we write:
A ⊄ B

INTERVALS AS SUBSETS OF REAL NUMBERS (ℝ)

Let a, b ∈ ℝ and a < b.

Open Interval
The set { y : a < y < b } is called an open interval and is denoted by (a, b).

In this interval, the points a and b are not included.

Closed Interval
The set { x : a ≤ x ≤ b } is called a closed interval and is denoted by [a, b].

Half-Open Intervals

[a, b) = { x : a ≤ x < b }

(a, b] = { x : a < x ≤ b }

Examples:

If A = (−3, 5) and B = [−7, 9], then A ⊆ B

The set [0, ∞) represents all non-negative real numbers

The set (−∞, 0) represents all negative real numbers

The set (−∞, ∞) represents all real numbers

Note:
Every interval contains infinitely many points.

Conversion Example:

{ x : x ∈ ℝ, −5 < x ≤ 7 } can be written as the interval (−5, 7]

The interval [−3, 5) can be written in set-builder form as { x : −3 ≤ x < 5 }

UNIVERSAL SET

In a particular context, the set that contains all objects under consideration is called the universal set.

The universal set is usually denoted by U.

Example:
While studying numbers, the set of natural numbers may be considered as the universal set, and its subsets may include:

the set of prime numbers

the set of even numbers

the set of odd numbers
